Create a backend and frontend web application to support league match information storage and retrieval using Python for the backend and JavaScript + HTML for the frontend. The frontend should be a client-side single-page app. Store the code in a GitHub repository and send me a link to your suggested solution. Spend a maximum of 4 hours on this task.


1. Backend: Create an HTTP API using Python 3 that supports HTTP GET and POST methods.
 
POST method: Accepts league match result data in JSON format for sports like football, ice hockey, or any other league game. Store the data in a database of your choice.
GET method: Retrieves stored league match result data from the database and returns it as JSON.


2. Frontend: Create a client-side single-page app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 
The app should include a form to input league match result data (e.g., sport, teams, scores, date).
On form submission, send the data to the backend API using a POST request.
Fetch the stored match results using the API's GET method, which returns data in JSON format, and display the results on the same page.


3. Bonus points for implementing the following:
 
Data validation (both client-side and server-side)
Error handling and proper display of error messages
A clean, user-friendly interface
Using Docker and Docker Compose for easy deployment and setup
